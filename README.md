[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://emdupre.github.io/ohbm2021-survey-feedback)

## Included contents

This repository contains feedback from the OHBM 2021 Annual Meeting Evaluation,
distributed to all registered meeting attendees.

Responses were provided on a Likert scale of 1-5,
where 1 indicates a 'Very Poor' experience with a given aspect of the event and 5 indicates an 'Excellent' experience.
Respondents could elect to skip one or more questions.
As a result, each of the included questions has a variable number of responses.

Note that we are only including anonymized answers to the subset of questions that are discussed in the
[recent blogpost summarizing feedback from the OHBM2021 annual meeting](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm2022-plans-ohbm2021-survey-results).
