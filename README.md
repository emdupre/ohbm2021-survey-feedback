## Included contents

This repository contains feedback from the OHBM 2021 Annual Meeting Evaluation,
distributed to all registered meeting attendees.

Responses were provided on a Likert scale of 1-5,
where 1 indicates a 'Very Poor' experience with a given aspect of the event and 5 indicates an 'Excellent' experience.
Respondents could elect to skip one or more questions.
As a result, each of the included questions has a variable number of responses.

Note that we are only including anonymized answers to the subset of questions that are discussed in the
recent blogpost summarizing OHBM 2021 feedback [LINK HERE WHEN POSTED].
